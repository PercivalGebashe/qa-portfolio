# Web Automation Testing - Enterprise Hiring Process (OrangeHRM)

## Overview

This project is an end-to-end web automation framework that validates the recruitment and hiring workflow of an HR management system (OrangeHRM).

The framework automates the complete hiring lifecycle using behavior-driven testing and production-style automation architecture.

It demonstrates:

* enterprise-level test automation design
* deterministic end-to-end workflow validation
* data-driven testing
* state-based verification
* failure reporting with screenshots

---

## System Under Test
OrangeHRM - Recruitment & Hiring Workflow

The test suite validates the full hiring pipeline:
```nginx
 Job Setup → Vacancy Creation → Candidate Lifecycle → Shortlist → Interview → Offer → Hire
```

## Scope

**In scope — End-to-End Hiring Workflow (Happy Path)**

* Admin authentication
* Job setup
* Vacancy creation
* Candidate creation
* Candidate lifecycle progression
* Hiring completion

**Out of scope**

* Candidate rejection flows 
* Offer decline scenarios 
* Negative validation testing 
* Post-hire employee validation

---

## Architecture

The framework follows a layered automation design:
```css
Cucumber Feature Files
        ↓
Step Definitions
        ↓
Page Object Model
        ↓
WebDriver Layer
        ↓
Utilities / TestRunContext / Test Data

```

**Key Design Patterns**

* Page Object Model (POM)
* Driver Factory pattern 
* Data-driven testing with JSON 
* Run-scoped test context 
* State-based assertions

---

## Framework Features

* Page Object Model implementation 
* Driver factory for browser management 
* Run-scoped unique test reference generation 
* JSON-based test data templates 
* Domain object deserialization 
* Test context for shared state across steps 
* State-based validation (not UI-only assertions)
* Screenshot capture on failure 
* Automatic HTML report generation 
* Clean separation of test logic and business data

---

## Tech Stack

* Java 17 
* Selenium WebDriver 
* TestNG 
* Cucumber (BDD)
* Extent Reports 
* Maven

## Reporting and Screenshots

Test execution produces:
* HTML execution reports
* Step logs
* Failure screenshots

see:
```bash
/reports
/screenshots

```

---

## Report Screenshots

After each test run, an interactive HTML report is generated using Extent Reports.

The report includes:
* Test execution summary (pass/fail/skip)
* Step-level logs 
* Failure details 
* Screenshot evidence for failed steps 
* Execution timestamps
